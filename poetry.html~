		<h1>Some Poems I have written</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>Wires</h2>
		<h3>Aritya Vitendra Arjunan</h3>
		<p>Flexible wires give us energy,</p>
		<p>And communication, and sound, and transport.</p>
		<p>They are useful in every way,</p>
		<p>Like air, water, and food.</p>
		<p>Wires brighten your mood,</p>
		<p>By allowing you to drive to the bay.</p>
		<p>Wires are serious; they only provide information (sometimes),</p>
		<p>They never laugh, they never cry,</p>
		<p>They only do your work for thy.</p>
		<br> <br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<h3>Aritya Vitendra Arjunan</h3>
		<p>The lapping of polluted water</p>
		<p>Is slaughtered for the creatures</p>
		<p>Are suffocating, the pollution cackling.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The lapping of clean water</p>
		<p>Is beautiful and pristine.</p>
		<p>The fish and the crabs can be seen.</p>
		<p>Fish flying through the air.</p>
		<p>Dolphins leaping is no longer rare.</p>
		<p>The waves breaking on the shore</p>
		<p>Sounds happy, on the third octave.</p>
		<br> <br>
		<h2>The Tree</h2>
		<h3>Aritya Vitendra Arjunan</h3>
		<p>The green Tree slowly moverd in the wind</p>
		<p>Using Sun as energy for growing</p>
		<p>How? By photosynthesis</p>
		<p>The animals are eating It but the Tree does not mind.</p>
		<br>
		<p>It is always very kind.</p>
		<p>The magic of chlorophyll, turning it green.</p>
		<p>It even works on a bean.</p>
		<p>And forever the Tree stands.</p>
		<br> <br>
		<h2>Chlorophyll</h2>
		<h3>Aritya Vitendra Arjunan</h3>
		<p>Chlorophyll</p>
		<p>Makes trees and plants green</p>
		<p>For growing</p>
		<br> <br>
